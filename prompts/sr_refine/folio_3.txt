# Context:
People eat meat regularly or are vegetation. If people eat meat regularly, then they enjoy eating hamburgers and steaks. All people who are vegetarian are conscious of the environment or their health. If people are conscious about the environment or their health, then they do not go to fast food places often.

# Context:
Some monitors produced by LG have a type-c port. If the monitor has a type-c port, then it is not produced by AOC. All monitors in the library are produced by AOC. L-2021 is either in the library or has a type-c port. L-2021 is either produced by AOC and produced by LG, or neither produced by AOC nor produced by LG.
# Question:
Based on the above information, is the following statement true, false, or uncertain? L-2021 either has a type-c port or is produced by LG.
# Options:
A) True
B) False
C) Uncertain
# Former Reasoning:
If L-2021 is produced by AOC and produced by LG. Then L-2021 either has a type-c port or is produced by LG is True. If L-2021 is not produced by AOC and not produced by LG and all monitors in the library are produced by AOC, therefore L-2021 is not in the library. L-2021 is either in the library or has a type-c port. Therefore L-2021 has a type-c port. So L-2021 either has a type-c port or is produced by LG.
# Feedback:
The reasoning is correct.
# Reasoning:
If L-2021 is produced by AOC and produced by LG. Then L-2021 either has a type-c port or is produced by LG is True. If L-2021 is not produced by AOC and not produced by LG and all monitors in the library are produced by AOC, therefore L-2021 is not in the library. L-2021 is either in the library or has a type-c port. Therefore L-2021 has a type-c port. So L-2021 either has a type-c port or is produced by LG.

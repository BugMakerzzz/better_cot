# Context:
There are 90 patients with a disease T that is very difficult to treat and has taken the same routine drug.The patients were divided into two equal groups. The first group was given an experimental drug W, which is used to treat T, and the second group was given a placebo without W. Statistics ten years later showed that 44 people died in both groups, so the experimental drug was ineffective.
# Question:
Based on the above information, which of the following options, if correct, will best weaken the above argument?
# Options:
A. Among the patients who died above, the average year of death in the second group was two years earlier than that in the first group
B. Among the patients who died, the average life span of the second group was two years younger than that of the first group
C. Among the above-mentioned living patients, the condition of the second group was more serious than that of the first group
D. Among the above-mentioned living patients, those in the second group were older than those in the first group
# Reasoning:
Analyzing each option: A suggests drug W might extend life since the average death year in the drug W group is later than the placebo, directly challenging the drug's perceived ineffectiveness. B, similar to A, implies longer life in the drug W group but doesn't directly link to post-treatment lifespan. C indicates drug W may reduce disease severity but doesn't address lifespan or mortality, the main focus. D, about age differences, lacks direct relevance to drug effectiveness. Therefore, A most effectively weakens the argument against drug W's effectiveness.
# Answer:
The answer is: A

# Context:
In parts of South America, vitamin-A deficiency is a serious health problem, especially among children. In one region, agriculturists are attempting to improve nutrition by encouraging farmers to plant a new variety of sweet potato called SPK004 that is rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. The plan has good chances of success, since sweet potato is a staple of the region' s diet and agriculture, and the varieties currently grown contain little beta-carotene.
# Question:
Based on the above information, which option is true? Which of the following, if true, most strongly supports the prediction that the plan will succeed?
# Options:
A) The flesh of spk004 differs from that of the currently cultivated sweet potatoes in color and texture, so traditional foods would look somewhat different when prepared from spk004.
B) There are no other varieties of sweet potato that are significantly richer in beta-carotene than spk004 is.
C) The varieties of sweet potato currently cultivated in the region contain some important nutrients that are lacking in spk004.
D) The growing conditions required by the varieties of sweet potato currently cultivated in the region are conditions in which spk004 can flourish.
# Reasoning:
To determine which option supports the prediction that introducing a new sweet potato variety (SPK004) will improve nutrition due to its high beta-carotene content: A suggests a change in food appearance, not directly supporting the plan. B states no other sweet potatoes are richer in beta-carotene than SPK004, slightly supporting the plan by highlighting SPK004's nutritional advantage. C mentions current varieties have nutrients SPK004 lacks, not supporting the plan's success. D indicates SPK004 can grow under current conditions, directly supporting the plan by ensuring ease of cultivation. Option D directly supports the plan's success by showing SPK004's adaptability to existing agricultural practices.
# Answer:
The answer is: D

# Reasoning:
To identify which scenario cannot be classified as a traffic accident crime, we analyze each based on the definition: a violation of traffic laws resulting in serious injury, death, or major property loss. A) Involves death and injuries from a collision, fitting the crime definition. B) Describes serious injury caused by a driver under the influence, also fitting the definition. C) Involves a braking incident without injury, death, or property loss, not fitting the crime definition. D) Results in multiple deaths due to speeding, clearly fitting the definition. Option C is the only scenario that does not meet the criteria of a traffic accident crime, as it involves no serious injury, death, or major property loss.
